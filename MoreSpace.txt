      This network of space-focused structures will lead to exponential growth in investment in the sector in the coming
      years, leading it to become a business worth more than USD 1 trillion.
   </p>
   <img src="Grafico.jpg" style="width:40%;"><br>
   <p>

      The areas of greatest interest will be Second order impacts, Ground equipment and Consumer Broadband.
   <p>
      <img src="Grafico2.jpg" style="width:50%;"><br>
   <p>
      The biggest investments will come from private agencies.
   </p>
   <img src="Grafico3.jpg" style="width:50%;"><br>
   <p>
      This will result in a drastic reduction in the cost of launching the modules into orbit.
   </p>
   <img src="Grafico4.jpg" style="width:50%;"><br>
   <p>
      It has been estimated that in the coming years the cost of bringing a kg into space will be only 100 dollars,
      finally allowing to be able to build a new city orbiting even cheaper.
      That's why we propose our idea of an orbiting hub where there can be a colony of 10,000 inhabitants in constant
      contact with universities and research centers around the world.

      The structure, whose name will be "orchid", consists of a sphere with function of hub for spacecrafts and four
      toroid rings that rotating manage to produce artificial gravity.
   </p>

   <p>
      Orchid, however, will not only be a great research centre, but there will also be room for ordinary citizens, as
      our idea is that of a self-sufficient society from an economic and food point of view.

      The value of many asteroids are measured in the quintillions of dollars, which makes the market for Earth’s annual
      production of raw metals – about $660 billion per year – look paltry in comparison
      Asteroid mining companies such as Planetary Resources and Deep Space Industries are the trailblazers in the
      sector, and they’ve already started to identify prospective targets to mine where no man has mined before.
      So far, roughly 15,000 asteroids have been discovered, and their orbits all come in close proximity to Earth.
   </p>
   <img src="Grafico6.jpg" style="width:50%;"><br>
   <p>
      These materials can also be used for the construction of the structure itself through the use of 3D printers. In
      this way it would largely reduce the costs of plant and management of the materials that can thus be assembled at
      0 gravity reducing the environmental impact of a project.
      Which would otherwise be destructive to the earth's ecosystem.
      It is in this perspective that the proximity of satellites such as the Moon could be an excellent reservoir of
      regolith used, through the Selective Laser Melting System, as a material for future structures.
   </p>
   <img src="Grafico7.jpg" style="width:50%;"><br>
   <p>
      Our idea, however, is not to build a huge laboratory, like ISS, but to create a structure that allows humanity to
      colonize space. As a result, large areas for crops and socialisation are needed. In regard to crops, imagine that
      much of the outer toroid will be dedicated to the green economy so that citizens can produce what they need to
      live, allowing them to become a long term Earth-independent colony.
      <br><br>
      This goes hand in hand with the need for a spatial jurisdiction because it will apply to civilians, not
      just experienced military personnel. It will therefore be necessary to involve the main international institutions
      as well as a team of lawyers and sociologists to follow the path of integrations of such diverse communities in
      such restricted environments.
      <br><br>
      Given the long period to spend on the facility, citizens will need to be shielded from cosmic radiation that could
      lead to cancer in the long run; one solution to this problem could be to create a magnetic field similar to that
      of Earth of about 0.52T (Tesla) through the use of magnesium diboruro superconductors (MgB2) which are cooled to
      temperatures close to 0K allow to shield the structure from the outside.
      <br><br>
      The project will also be an important resource to connect the world of universities with the space sector. Aboard the 
      station, the most deserving projects proposed by students from all over the world will be selected each
      year to be realized in the district that includes the workshops.<br>
